                <h1>GREEN</h1>
                <div>
                    <p>Green represents growth, nature, and harmony. It values the natural order, embracing life’s cycles and the interconnectedness of all things. Green believes in thriving by understanding and respecting nature rather than controlling it. It celebrates strength through balance, seeking to nurture what already exists rather than change or dominate the world around it.</p>

                    <p>In gameplay, Green focuses on powerful creatures, mana acceleration, and building a strong board presence. Its spells often enhance creatures, provide lands, or destroy artifacts and enchantments, reflecting its affinity for natural resources. Green’s creatures, from towering beasts to agile predators, showcase its belief in primal power and adaptability over clever tricks or elaborate schemes.</p>
                    
                    <p>However, Green’s adherence to the natural order can make it resistant to innovation or change. It prioritizes instinct and growth over intellect or control, sometimes leaving it vulnerable to disruption. Despite this, Green’s core philosophy teaches that true power lies in unity with the forces of life, ensuring stability and flourishing in a world that grows stronger by following its inherent design.</p>

                            <p>Green is often associated with nature, growth, and power. This is reflected in the color's mechanics, which often involve large creatures. These are usually powerful cards with high mana costs and high power/toughness stats. They can often turn the tide of a game, especially in the late game.<br>For example, the card "Quakethrider Ceratops" is a classic green creature. It's a massive dinosaur with a high toughness, making it difficult to remove from the battlefield. This is a common theme for green creatures: they're big, tough, and often have abilities that let them grow even larger or regenerate.</p>

                            <h2 class="naranja">Ramp</h2>
                            <p>The term "ramp" refers to the act of accelerating your mana production. This means playing spells that let you put extra lands into play, giving you more mana to cast your bigger or more expensive spells earlier in the game. Green is the color most associated with ramp due to its thematic connection to nature and growth.<br>The card "Cultivate" is a classic example of ramp. It allows you to search your library for two basic land cards, then put one of them into play tapped. This gives you two extra lands in exchange for a single card, allowing you to cast more expensive spells sooner. Green's ability to ramp is a key part of its strategy, as it allows players to cast their powerful creatures and spells ahead of their opponents.</p>

                            <h2 class="naranja">Combat Tricks</h2>
                            <p>A "combat trick" is an instant spell that temporarily boosts a creature's power or toughness, often to give it an advantage in combat. While all colors can have combat tricks, green is particularly known for its ability to quickly pump up its creatures for a surprise attack or to protect them from removal.<br>A prime example of a green combat trick is "Giant Growth." This inexpensive spell allows you to give a creature +3/+3 until end of turn. This can be a game-changer, turning a relatively weak creature into a formidable attacker or blocker.</p>
