                <h1>RED</h1>
                <div>
                    <p>Red embodies passion, freedom, and emotion in Magic: The Gathering. It values living in the moment, following one’s heart, and embracing the chaos of life. Red seeks authenticity, rejecting restraint and calculation in favor of spontaneity and action. It celebrates creativity, individuality, and the beauty of raw, unfiltered experiences, seeing freedom as the ultimate expression of truth.</p>

                    <p>In gameplay, Red is aggressive and fast-paced, reflecting its impulsive and fiery nature. It specializes in direct damage, hasty creatures, and chaotic effects that disrupt opponents or turn the tide of battle unpredictably. Red thrives on overwhelming foes with relentless attacks or explosive spells, often sacrificing long-term stability for immediate impact and excitement.</p>
                    
                    <p>However, Red’s love of freedom and passion can lead to recklessness and volatility. Its decisions, while heartfelt, may lack foresight, resulting in unintended consequences. Despite these flaws, Red’s essence lies in its celebration of life’s intensity. It reminds us that to truly live is to embrace joy, sorrow, love, and fury alike, reveling in the vivid spectrum of existence without fear of failure or regret.</p>

                            <h2 class="naranja">Direct Damage</h2>
                            <p>Direct damage refers to spells or abilities that deal damage to players, creatures, or planeswalkers without requiring combat. This mechanic allows players to remove threats or reduce life totals efficiently and often unpredictably. Red specializes in direct damage because it embodies passion, aggression, and immediacy. Red seeks quick, impactful solutions and thrives on raw power.<br>The card "Lightning Bolt" exemplifies this by dealing 3 damage to any target for just one mana, showcasing Red’s explosive potential and its preference for fast, decisive action to dominate the battlefield.</p>

                            <h2 class="naranja">Looting</h2>
                            <p>In Magic: The Gathering, looting refers to drawing cards and then discarding, allowing players to cycle through their deck for better options. This mechanic balances gaining new resources with shedding less useful ones, promoting adaptability and speed. Red embraces looting as it reflects its impulsive and chaotic nature. Red values action over deliberation, and looting enables quick decision-making by prioritizing the present over the future.<br>The card "Faithless Looting" exemplifies this, drawing two cards and discarding two for just one mana, showcasing Red’s willingness to embrace risk and spontaneity for potential explosive gains.</p>

                            <h2 class="naranja">Attacking</h2>
                            <p>Attacking is a core mechanic where creatures deal damage to opponents or their planeswalkers, pushing toward victory. Aggressive strategies focus on maximizing damage through relentless attacks, often overwhelming opponents before they can stabilize. Red thrives on attacking because it embodies passion, speed, and raw power. It views combat as the purest expression of its philosophy: direct, impactful, and immediate. <br>The card "Aggravated Assault" exemplifies this by giving all attacking creatures an additional chance to get into the fighting grounds, turning a coordinated assault into a devastating blow. This aligns with Red’s emphasis on seizing opportunities and winning through sheer force.</p>
