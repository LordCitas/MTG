                <div>
                    <p>Green represents growth, nature, and harmony. It values the natural order, embracing life’s cycles and the interconnectedness of all things. Green believes in thriving by understanding and respecting nature rather than controlling it. It celebrates strength through balance, seeking to nurture what already exists rather than change or dominate the world around it.</p>

                    <p>In gameplay, Green focuses on powerful creatures, mana acceleration, and building a strong board presence. Its spells often enhance creatures, provide lands, or destroy artifacts and enchantments, reflecting its affinity for natural resources. Green’s creatures, from towering beasts to agile predators, showcase its belief in primal power and adaptability over clever tricks or elaborate schemes.</p>
                    
                    <p>However, Green’s adherence to the natural order can make it resistant to innovation or change. It prioritizes instinct and growth over intellect or control, sometimes leaving it vulnerable to disruption. Despite this, Green’s core philosophy centers on embracing the world’s beauty and strength. It teaches that true power lies in unity with the forces of life, ensuring stability and flourishing in a world that grows stronger by following its inherent design.</p>

                            <p>Permanents with the "equipment" subtype are artifacts that can be attached to a creature, granting it additional abilities or increasing its power and toughness. While any color can benefit from equipment, colorless artifacts, due to their neutral nature, have a unique synergy with this mechanic.<br>The card "Lightning Greaves" is a prime example. As a colorless artifact, it can be equipped to any creature, regardless of its color. This versatility is a hallmark of colorless equipment. By attaching the Lightning Greaves to a creature, you allow it to tap and/or attack without having to wait for a turn rotation while being protected, making it possible for players to turn slow, bulky creatures into massive and hard to interact threats.</p>

                            <p>Artifacts that produce mana when tapped are commonly referred to as "mana rocks". They are colloquially called "rocks" due to their artwork, usually being engravings or stone effigies. Although there are plenty dedicated to producing each other color's mana, the most efficient mana rocks are in colorless because of the restricion it implies (colorless mana is harder to spend).<br>A prime example of a mana rock is the "Sol Ring." This iconic artifact allows you to tap it for two colorless mana, at the casting cost os jut one mana. Its ability to accelerate a player's mana development makes it a highly sought-after card in many decks, making it the most renowned of its kind.</p>

                            <h2 class="naranja">Artifacts</h2>
                            <p>An "artifact" is a permanent that is not a creature, enchantment, or planeswalker. They are often tools or machines, and they come in a wide variety of types, from equipment to mana rocks. Because they usually don't rely on a specific color of mana, artifacts are considered colorless, and therefore part of the "Colorless Identity".<br>The card "Staff of Domination" is a classic example of a powerful artifact. As a colorless artifact, it can be used in any deck. It provides a range of abilities from which to choose, each of them granting various effects in increasing value and cost. Additionally, this artifact allows itself to untap on activation, making it a potential combo piece.</p>
