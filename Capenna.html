                <h1>A Gilded Plane of Crime and Glamour</h1>
                <div>
                    <p>New Capenna is a sprawling plane defined by its shimmering decadence and gritty underworld. Built atop the ruins of an ancient civilization, the city is a marvel of Art Deco-inspired architecture, blending luxury with shadows of its mysterious past.<br>The key to its power lies in Halo, a magical substance that fuels both the opulence of the elite and the ambitions of the desperate, providing inhumane strength, supernatural healing and enhanced senses.</p>

                    <p>The plane is ruled by five rival crime families: the conniving Obscura, the zealous Brokers, the ambitious Maestros, the relentless Riveteers, and the flamboyant Cabaretti. Each family wields distinct magic and influence, vying for control over New Capenna’s streets and secrets. Beneath the glamour of their speakeasies, skyscrapers, and lavish galas, lies a brutal struggle for dominance, where alliances are fragile, and betrayal is commonplace.</p>

                    <p>Inhabitants of New Capenna walk a fine line between survival and indulgence, their lives shaped by the city’s widespread corruption and inevitable allure.<br>For visitors, it is a world of intrigue, a labyrinth of power plays and moral dilemmas where everyone puts their own interests first. Whether drawn by its beauty or its danger, they must find a way to navigate a web of deception where ambition rules, and nothing is ever as it seems.</p>

                            <p>Led by the sphinx-demon Raphine, the Obscura are talented wizards and mystics who use their power to deceive and blackmail, using distractions, illusions, and hidden mechanisms. They orchestrate scenarios and manipulate outcomes to their benefit. They deal in prophecy, fortune telling, and esoteric communion with dreams and the realm of the dead, all the while endeavoring to maintain a facade of normalcy in their everyday lives which allows them to run their schemes without disruption.</p>

                            <p>Led by the demon-aven Falco Spara, the originator of the Brokers's contract-weaving abilities, the Brokers are a demonic law firm that secretly believes a doomsday prophecy that when the halo dries up, New Capenna will fail. They maintain public law offices where they handle mundane matters like property disputes and physical grievances. But their aggressive solicitors have a dubious reputation for being everywhere and showing up at every crisis in the city.<p>

Opulent revelers, the Cabaretti run dance halls, concert venues, and the finest restaurants up and down the city's boroughs. They are the glitterati of the city and everyone wants to be invited to their feasts and dance halls. They use ancient magic to sway the opinion of the masses and keep the halo flowing.</p>

                            <p>Led by the vampire Anhelo, the Maestros are New Capenna's premier assassins, vampiric professional killers who see a contract not just as business but as a chance to perform. They maintain a warped and self-serving view of their work: they are saviors of the city, philanthropists beyond compare, and are ruthless in their pursuit of the fame and cultural cache that they believe they deserve. They will kill without a thought or moment of regret if it means achieving their goals.</p>

They are a rowdy, action-first, move-fast-and-break-things crime family whose members are not afraid of fighting hammer and nail to accomplish their goals. Once a union of workers, the Riveteers still hold to many of the values that once organized them: loyalty, strength in numbers, and mutual support.</p>
