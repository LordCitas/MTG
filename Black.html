                <h1>BLUE</h1>
                <div>
                    <p>Black represents ambition, power, and self-determination in Magic: The Gathering. It seeks strength through independence, rejecting the constraints of morality and tradition. Black believes in taking what it wants, regardless of cost, viewing life as a struggle where the boldest and most resourceful thrive. It values pragmatism, embracing both life and death as tools for achieving its goals.</p>

                    <p>In gameplay, Black is defined by its willingness to pay any price for victory. It often sacrifices life, creatures, or other resources to gain advantages. Mechanics like graveyard recursion, targeted removal, and life drain reflect its themes of power and resilience. Black’s creatures, such as zombies, vampires, and demons, often embody its dark, opportunistic nature, thriving on the cycle of death and rebirth.</p>
                    
                    <p>Black sees others as either tools or obstacles, willing to exploit or destroy anything in its path. While it can embody selfishness and greed, Black also represents freedom, rejecting external control in favor of forging its destiny. Ultimately, Black’s essence lies in its belief that strength and success are earned through unyielding determination and the courage to embrace the darkness within.</p>

                            <h2 class="naranja">Removal</h2>
                            <p>Removal refers to spells or abilities that eliminate threats by destroying or exiling permanents, often creatures. Removal is vital for disrupting opponents’ strategies and maintaining control over the game. Black excels in removal because it embodies power, ruthlessness, and inevitability. It willingly destroys to achieve its goals, embracing death as a tool.<br>The ubiquitous card "Murder" exemplifies this, offering unconditional creature destruction at instant speed. This reflects Black’s pragmatic approach, removing obstacles efficiently and without moral hesitation to ensure its dominance.</p>

                            <h2 class="naranja">Sacrifice</h2>
                            <p>Sacrifice involves deliberately giving up a permanent, often to gain an advantage or force an opponent to do the same. This mechanic represents strategic loss for greater gain, adding depth and tension to gameplay. Sacrifice aligns with Black’s philosophy of ambition and pragmatism, because it embraces the idea that power comes at a cost, and this color is definitely willing to make or demand sacrifices to secure victory.<br>"Plaguecrafter" exemplifies this by forcing all players to sacrifice a creature or planeswalker. This showcases Black's willingness to leverage sacrifice to control the battlefield and maintain its advantage.</p>

                            <h2 class="naranja">Discard</h2>
                            <p>Discard refers to forcing players to remove cards from their hand, often before they can be played. This mechanic disrupts opponents’ strategies by depriving them of key resources, creating an advantage by limiting their options. Black excels at discard because it thrives on control and exploitation. It uses discard to weaken opponents, reflecting its ruthless and calculated nature.<br>"Duress" exemplifies this by targeting noncreature spells in an opponent’s hand, stripping away threats or answers. This aligns with Black’s philosophy of seizing opportunities by dismantling others’ plans to ensure its dominance.</p>
