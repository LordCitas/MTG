                <h1>El plano de los dioses y semidioses</h1>
                <p>
                    Eldraine is a whimsical and enchanting plane in Magic: The Gathering, inspired by European fairy tales and Arthurian legends. The plane is a land of knights, royalty, and magical creatures, where the boundaries between myth and reality are blurred. Eldraine is divided into several realms, each with its own unique characteristics, from the idyllic and noble kingdom of Ardenvale to the dark and mysterious Wilds of the realm, home to tricksters and ancient beings.
                    
                    At the heart of Eldraine’s story is its royal court, ruled by the powerful and capricious fae. These fae are both mischievous and dangerous, weaving complex webs of intrigue and magic. The people of Eldraine, whether they are brave knights, clever witches, or honorable nobles, are often caught in their schemes, striving to achieve greatness or simply survive the ever-present threats.
                    
                    The plane is also home to magical quests, where heroes embark on journeys filled with trials, challenges, and temptations. Eldraine’s connection to classic fairy tales brings forth familiar motifs, such as enchanted castles, wicked witches, and legendary swords. However, in true Magic: The Gathering fashion, Eldraine adds layers of complexity, where characters’ morals and decisions are often tested, and where the line between good and evil can be as shifting as the fae themselves. Eldraine is a land where magic, adventure, and the unexpected are always just around the corner.</p>

                            <p>Algenus Kenrith, known as the Good King, is the ruler of Ardenvale and High King of the Realm on Eldraine. He is husband to Queen Linden Kenrith, and father to Erec, Hazel, Rowan and Will Kenrith. Renowned as a canny fighter, he is only bested by his wife, and is currently the only person in the Realm to have earned knighthoods at all five courts. Nevertheless, he is not a particularly inquisitive or deep-thinking man — he leaves that to Linden.</p>

                            <p>Gadwick, the Wizened, is a human wizard of Eldraine, the archmage of Vantress. Unlike the other courts, Vantress has no official ruler. Instead, the people of Vantress are led by the Magic Mirror, Indrelon, itself. However, most of the day-to-day responsibilities tend to fall on one or two notable Vantress loremages like him. It takes a sharp mind to earn the Mirror's respect and decipher its cryptic instructions, so the position of archmage is regarded with a level of respect reserved for the monarchs in other courts.<p>

Ayara weds the champions of Locthwain who seek the Cauldron on the evening before they set out on their ultimately fatal quests. By tradition, a year and a day after a champion sets off on the quest, Ayara declares the champion lost and holds a funeral party. More often than not, the party carries over into the next day, transforming the new dawn into a wedding feast for the queen and her next champion spouse.</p>

                            <p>Torbran is the current Thane of the dwarvish clan of Red Fell. As the story goes, he traveled to Embereth in his youth to compete for knighthood. Though he defeated each foe he faced, when the time came to claim his prize and strike the Irencrag, he refused. According to him, the Irencrag had insulted the craftsmanship of his weapon. Unwilling to give the stone the satisfaction of tasting his blade, Torbran left Embereth and returned to the Wilds. Some consider him a coward for leaving, but many others believe that he will one day return to claim his rightful knighthood.</p>

                            <p>Yorvo is a benevolent, green-bearded giant, who towers over even others of his kind and has ruled as king of Garenbrig for at least two human generations. Yorvo's throne stands under the shelter of the gnomon stone that overhangs the court, symbolically holding up the weight of the stone and protecting the people of Garenbrig. To all the court's knights and nobles, Yorvo and his throne are a reminder of the proper use of strength: protecting those less strong than yourself.</p>
