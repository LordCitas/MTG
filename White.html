                <h1>WHITE</h1>
                <div>
                    <p>White embodies order, justice, and community in Magic: The Gathering. It seeks harmony through structure, promoting laws, fairness, and equality.<br>This color values collective good over individual ambition, believing in the strength of unity and cooperation. Through ideals like protection and healing, White strives to create a peaceful, stable environment where everyone has a chance to thrive under shared rules.</p>

                    <p>At its heart, White prioritizes selflessness, often manifesting in mechanics like life gain, token generation, and damage prevention. Its spells bolster allies and shield them from harm, emphasizing solidarity and teamwork. In battle, White prefers disciplined strategies, such as swarming with armies of smaller creatures or locking opponents out with enchantments, reflecting its belief in order and calculated tactics over chaos.</p>
                    
                    <p>However, White’s pursuit of perfection can lead to rigidity and authoritarianism. In its darker aspects, it may enforce its vision of “justice” at any cost, suppressing individuality or dissent in the name of peace. Despite these flaws, White’s essence lies in its commitment to creating a world where fairness prevails and the greater good is prioritized. Whether through compassion or control, White’s ultimate goal is a balanced, harmonious existence for all.</p>
