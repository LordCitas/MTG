                <h1>WHITE</h1>
                <div>
                    <p>White embodies order, justice, and community in Magic: The Gathering. It seeks harmony through structure, promoting laws, fairness, and equality.<br>This color values collective good over individual ambition, believing in the strength of unity and cooperation. Through ideals like protection and healing, White strives to create a peaceful, stable environment where everyone has a chance to thrive under shared rules.</p>

                    <p>At its heart, White prioritizes selflessness, often manifesting in mechanics like life gain, token generation, and damage prevention. Its spells bolster allies and shield them from harm, emphasizing solidarity and teamwork. In battle, White prefers disciplined strategies, such as swarming with armies of smaller creatures or locking opponents out with enchantments, reflecting its belief in order and calculated tactics over chaos.</p>
                    
                    <p>However, White’s pursuit of perfection can lead to rigidity and authoritarianism. In its darker aspects, it may enforce its vision of “justice” at any cost, suppressing individuality or dissent in the name of peace. Despite these flaws, White’s essence lies in its commitment to creating a world where fairness prevails and the greater good is prioritized. Whether through compassion or control, White’s ultimate goal is a balanced, harmonious existence for all.</p>

                            <h2 class="naranja">Life-Gain</h2>
                            <p>White has more life-gain spells than any other color. This includes spells that cause you to gain a set amount of life, or to gain life equal to some permanents or cards. Spells or abilities that would double a player's life total appear exclusively in white, as do creatures and creature tokens whose power and toughness are dependent on a player's life total.<br>This mechanic is helped by the mechanic Lifelink, which causes life gain whenever a creature deals damage. In this instance, Heliod, the Sun-Crowned is card known for its potential in life-gain decks, being both a payoff and an enabler for life-gain.</p>

                            <h2 class="naranja">Boardwipes</h2>
                            <p>A boardwipe refers to a spell that destroys or removes most or all creatures (and sometimes other permanents) on the battlefield. These spells reset the board state, often turning the tide of a game by neutralizing overwhelming threats.<br>In White, boardwipes like Wrath of God or Farewell reflect its ideals of order and balance. White views destruction as a means to restore harmony when chaos dominates. By clearing the battlefield, White enforces fairness, ensuring no single player can maintain unchecked power. This fits White’s philosophy of prioritizing collective good over individual dominance.</p>

                            <h2 class="naranja">Taxes</h2>
                            <p>Taxes refer to effects that make actions—like casting spells, activating abilities, or attacking—cost more resources, slowing opponents down. These mechanics disrupt opponents’ strategies without direct removal, forcing them to adapt or delay their plays.<br>White embodies taxes as a way to maintain order and fairness, reflecting its focus on structure and restraint. Cards like Thalia, Guardian of Thraben exemplify this by increasing noncreature spell costs. Thalia imposes rules that level the playing field, ensuring no player can act too freely, embodying White's philosophy of balance through control.</p>
